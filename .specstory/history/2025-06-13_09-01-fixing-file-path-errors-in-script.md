# Fixing file path errors in script (2025-06-13 12:01:08)

Your script `gradiodemo.py` is failing with the following error:

```
os.chdir("/app/Sim3DR")
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/Sim3DR'
```

**Reason:**  
The script is trying to change the working directory to `/app/Sim3DR`, but this directory does not exist on your system. Your actual project path is `/Users/victorkhudyakov/nn/3DDFA2/Sim3DR`.

**How to fix:**  
You should update all hardcoded `/app/...` paths in your script to use the correct local paths.  
For portability, you can use `os.path.join` with `os.getcwd()` or `os.path.dirname(__file__)` to construct paths relative to your project root.

**Here’s what you should change:**

- Replace `/app/Sim3DR` with `/Users/victorkhudyakov/nn/3DDFA2/Sim3DR`
- Replace `/app/utils/asset` with `/Users/victorkhudyakov/nn/3DDFA2/utils/asset`
- Replace `/app` with `/Users/victorkhudyakov/nn/3DDFA2`

Or, better, use relative paths based on your script’s location.

Would you like me to update the script to use the correct paths and make it portable?
